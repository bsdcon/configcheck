BUGS
====
* Bug: normal # characters inside commands/files will be misintepreted as
  comment separator
* Bug: if the source file is missing write permissions then (next time) a
  change is detected it won't be able to save (overwrite) into the target store
* Bug: if the diff output that is included in the report contains non-ASCII
  characters, then the email report will contain a binary attachment instead
  of being plain-text

ENHANCEMENTS
============
* Enhancement: in the generated report, mention the (full path) name of the
  config list which generated the current reporting entry (to trace the source
  of the generated data)
* Enhancement: refactoring to allow porting the script to various platforms
  (e.g. use compat_* files in a lib directory)

NEW FEATURES
============
* Feature: add "=" filter marker to consider all command output / file contents
  as changed data to report
* Feature: add a "reporting level" directive that will allow reporting the next
  data (additionally) in a different mode (e.g. alerts instead of normal reports)
* Feature: allow executing statements without tracking them, for example prefix
  them with a ":" modifier
* Feature: allow defining / changing environment variables in the config lists,
  possibly using aforementioned statements, and make them persistent throughout
  the current session/list)
* Feature: allow using an "aliases" definitions file (e.g. to allow using the same
  grep command among diverse platforms)
* Feature: allow overriding any filesystem size limitations
* Feature: allow setting the file(system) size limitations to 0 to be ignored
* Feature: allow setting a limit on the amount of disk usage for the history store
* Feature: allow defining a "local" configuration file to override the generic
  default settings without changing the main file (e.g. configcheck.conf.local)
* Feature: allow switching between "full" and "difference" mode for the history
  store (e.g. either retain only version differences or take full snapshots)
* Possible feature: encrypt store contents with a key
